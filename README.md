toolfrog


# MISSION

It's toolfrog. What if the public could easily manage their own transactions, transparently and open-sourcy-like

# INSTALLATION AND RUN

This is a node/react program. Node, and a browser, are required to view it.

* npm i
* npm run start
* Program should load within a browser at localhost:3000

# WIP. Capabilities so far:

Load, Save, Retrieve and Display unspent transactions using the blockcypher.io API. 

Load transactions from either API or from JSON file. Select multiple transactions, and save selected transactions to json file.

# NOTES

This is a dogecoin program. Pull requests for porting to other coins won't be accepted. The intent here is that it should be a trivial thing to port this program in support of some other coin. Meaningful contributions to the code base are otherwise welcomed. At some point this may become known as a dogecoin-community supported project.

We start with a transaction manager, and then we make it cute and easy.
